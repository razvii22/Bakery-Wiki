# Origins

Origins of SCP-RAZ are unknown so far. What is known is that this creature is not of anthropomorphic origin. He might look human, but looks often deceive. His looks could perchance draw you in closer with the promise of a good time. But once close enough, you will get devoured mentally, leaving nothing but a hollow husk behind.
