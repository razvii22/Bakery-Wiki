**Diabetic, Rapper, Sound Engineer, Moron, Angry, British**

Jeremy is a colossal knob-head previously in charge of the incoherent mess he has created.
Upon his stepping down from power and forcing the responsibility onto [razvii](/razvii.md), Jeremy, willingly*, has taken a support role in the process.
He can now be seen constructing incoherent modern brutalist messes, calling speakers "monitors" and helping out with the video broadcasts.

# Bakery Wiki Theme
It is important to note that Jeremy has a surprisingly high tolerance for bullshit, incomprehensible nonsense and counterintuitive design.
This has led him down the dark part of pursuing CSS and general web design.
This has proved particularly invaluable after [razvii](/razvii.md) has entirely and irrecoverably lost their mind trying to comprehend the subject.
Therefore, Jeremy is entirely responsible for the visual design and UI of the [bakery-wiki-theme](https://github.com/razvii22/bakery-wiki-theme) project and he is to be reluctantly thanked for this project seeing the light of day.

# "Hobbies"

Jeremy, surprisingly enough (if you look hard enough), does feature a personality that isn't JUST being a cynical and
grumpy old man.
He does actually seem to partake in human hobbies, despite numerous predictions saying otherwise!
Some of these "hobbies" include:

### Audio engineering

Jeremy, possibly due to some external influences, seems to have taken a particular interest in mixing, mastering and general sound engineering, as well as media production in general, which has led to him following an education in the field.
This hobby and job of his proves to be invaluably exploitable.

### Trains
Jeremy has an unhealthy obsession with trains and train related technology.
Despite a concerning amount of his digital locomotives resembling **[REDACTED]**, and the utter inability for anyone but him to operate them, they are technically functional and within spec.
This has never ceased to irritate [razvii](/razvii.md)

### Cheese

Jeremy seems to be concerning enamored with cheese, talking about it constantly and even going as far as to acrue a large collection of [cheese facts](#cheese-facts).
This seeming obsession of his is both concerning and being monitored closely.

<!-- ### Gardening
I thought we all agreed not to talk about what happened. -->

# Diabetes

Scruby sold the rights to his pancreas to various authorities as a means of payment despite only having 1 pancreas. Very quickly he fell into pancreatic debt and had to declare himself "pancreas bankrupt". This meant sacrificing his pancreas and living the rest of his life having to do hard Insulin and chewing hard Glucose Tablets.  

# Cheese facts

This section has been moved to [cheese](../cheese.md) for the sake of everyone involved.

# Miscellaneous
Scruby also enjoys being stalked by strange American bible men on the internet.

~~Scruby enjoys avoiding taxation from Her Majesties Revenue and Customs of Her Majesties Government of Her Majesties United Kingdom of England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Isles.~~
Oops nevermind lol.

Hahhahahaha. Nope. Don't need that here. Scruby doesn't do this. All his VAT rebates are legal, sound transaction. Hahaha LOL
