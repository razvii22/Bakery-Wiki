The baking boys have been known to dabble in a wee bit of chess.  
Specifically, on some [streams](../people/razvii.md#streams), [Jeremy](../people/jeremy.md) and [razvii](../people/razvii.md) will occasionally play chess against one another, this often upsets and demoralizes Jeremy.  
As such, to even the odds on the battlefield, the idea of playing [variations](#variants) has been introduced, where the rules of chess are turned upside down, inside out, and ocasionally... [diagonal](#diagonal-chess)...

# Variants
The following is a non comprehensive list of chess rules variations, as well as links to their respective websites.  
The list is in the rough order of how liked the variants are:

    <blockquote blame="Greenchess.net">These chess variants involve new chess pieces, which do not exist in standard chess, but are similar to those.</blockquote>
    <p>
        Fairy chess is a category of chess on <a href="https://greenchess.net" class="external-link">greenchess.net</a> where certain pieces are replaced by alternative versions with different, often really weird move sets.<br>
        A good example is whatever the hell this is:

        Duck chess is a variant of chess on <a href="https://chess.com" class="external-link">chess.com</a> where a completely inert duck piece exists on the board. <br>
        On each turn, after the player has made their regular move, they will then need to move the duck piece on any empty space on the board.<br>
        The duck piece serves to block the opponent from making certain moves, it cannot take pieces, it cannot be taken, it can only quack. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Fear its quacking might.

    <p>
        Spell chess is a variant of chess on <a href="https://chess.com" class="external-link">chess.com</a> where each player can use a spell before their turn.
    </p>
    <p>
        By default each player gets 5 jump spells and 5 freeze spells.<br>
        The spells recharge after 3 turns and you cannot use the same spell back to back.
    </p>
    <p>
        The freeze spell can be used to freeze all spaces in a 3x3 square, while the jump spell can be cast on a piece in order to move as if that piece wasn't there, "jumping" over it.
