It's the block game.

## Boating

Boating is the as yet unconfirmed name given temporarily to a modded minecraft saga which began in 2023. The server revolves around the Create mod - presumably on a mechanical or windmill bearing - with multiple support mods and addons.

Initially, only [Brent](wiki/people/brent.md "Brent") and [Raz](wiki/people/razvii.md "Raz") had access to the mod list and thus the world.
Following a fit of jealousy, [Jeremy](wiki/people/jeremy.md) was eventually added to the server.
