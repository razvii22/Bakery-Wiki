{%- raw -%}<sup><sub>Disclaimer, not actually a bakery.</sub></sup><br>{% endraw %}

The bakery is a tiny group of larping nerds that like to play games and sometimes get along.  
The bakery itself serves as the central source of knowledge on everything related to aforementioned nerds, their whereabouts, schedules, releases, released code and anything that we decide is funny enough to go on here.

# Nerds

The bakery consists of the following baking bois:

- ### [Razvii](/wiki/people/razvii.md)
  The main streaming nerd as of late, he sometimes codes, other times he just meows.

---

- ### [Lord_Scruby](/wiki/people/jeremy.md)
  The nerd with an unhealthy obsession with sound mixing, audio gear and [Cheese.](/wiki/people/jeremy.md#Cheese)

---

- ### [BrentyWenty](/wiki/people/brent.md)
  The only true nerd that studies computer science and thus actually has a life.  
  Ironically he does none of the coding in this group.
